# science-fair-2023
This is a grade 8 science fair project trying to optimaly solve a 2x2 rubik's cube. This project is participating in the Calgary Youth Sience Fair.

The code keeps track of the cube through an array of the colored cube tiles and has the moves, checking if it's solved, if it's equal to another cube and rendering of the cube hard coded in the cube class. The current solver has a brute forced file of all cubes with their respective solutions kept track of up to depth 5. Using that file it does a look up of the current cube if it finds the current cube then the cube is solved otherwise it just keps on going. In the future I will try to make 3D rendering but for now I will focus on the math side of the problem.
